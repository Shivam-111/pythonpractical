# In a steel plant, the quality of steel is graded according to the following conditions:

# (i) Hardness must be greater than 50
# (ii) Carbon content must be less than 0.7
# (iii) Tensile strength mut be greater than 5600

# The grades are as follows:
# Grade is 10 if all three conditions are met
# Grade is 9 if conditions (i) and (ii) are met
# Grade is 8 if conditions (ii) and (iii) are met
# Grade is 7 if conditions (i) and (iii) are met
# Grade is 6 if only one condition is met
# Grade is 5 if none of the conditions are met

# Construct a program, which will require the user to give values
# of hardness, carbon content and tensile strength of the steel under
# consideration and output the grade of the steel.
