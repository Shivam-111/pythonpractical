Develop a program that asks the user to enter a series of integers and store them in a Tuple.
Perform the following:

a) Print the total number of items in the Tuple.
b) Print the last item in the Tuple.
c) Print the Tuple elements in reverse order.
d) Print Yes if the Tuple contains an integer 5 and No otherwise.
e) Remove the first and last items from the Tuple, sort the remaining items, and print the result.

# c) Reverse order
